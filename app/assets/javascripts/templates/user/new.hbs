    By signing up and using this system, you agree to abide by the JCCC convention / harassment policy that you were
    required to sign. Basically: follow Wheaton's Law and please don't try to ruin this for someone else.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having said this, if someone on Twit-arr is behaving in a manner that does NOT follow the harassment policy, then
    please seek out any of the fine helper monkeys and they can assist. Helper monkeys should seek assistance from @kvort
    on anything technical that needs doing re: Harassment.

    Due to technical restrictions, the security available on the ship is akin to
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">writing your password on a post-it and placing the post-it on your forehead.</span>
    At least, it is to anyone skilled and motivated to do such things. (I think we left those people on shore, but just to be safe...)

    DO NOT USE the same password or security question/answer that you have used for ANYTHING ELSE.
