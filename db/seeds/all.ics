Focusing only on national politics ignores how it ladders up from grassroots advocacy and local politics. 2. Our national situation didn't happen overnight...it won't be fixed in 2018. The chance of burnout is high. How can you manage your activism and expectations to make change for the long haul? How can you leverage technology and game strategy to triage\, personalize\, activate\, and track your corner of the resistance?

SUMMARY:Johann Sebastian Joust
DESCRIPTION:Johann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics\, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers.The goal is to be the last player remaining. When the music — J.S. Bach's ‌Brandenburg Concertos — plays in slow-motion\, the controllers are very sensitive to movement. When the music speeds up\, the threshold becomes less strict\, giving the players a small window to dash at their opponents. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold\, you're out! Try to jostle your opponents' controllers while protecting your own.

SUMMARY:Johann Sebastian Joust
DESCRIPTION:Johann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics\, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers.The goal is to be the last player remaining. When the music — J.S. Bach's ‌Brandenburg Concertos — plays in slow-motion\, the controllers are very sensitive to movement. When the music speeds up\, the threshold becomes less strict\, giving the players a small window to dash at their opponents. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold\, you're out! Try to jostle your opponents' controllers while protecting your own.

SUMMARY:Johann Sebastian Joust
DESCRIPTION:Johann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics\, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers.The goal is to be the last player remaining. When the music — J.S. Bach's ‌Brandenburg Concertos — plays in slow-motion\, the controllers are very sensitive to movement. When the music speeds up\, the threshold becomes less strict\, giving the players a small window to dash at their opponents. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold\, you're out! Try to jostle your opponents' controllers while protecting your own.

DESCRIPTION:Since November 9th\, 2016 everyday people are fired up and looking for ways to be the change they want to see. Two challenges: 1. Focusing only on national politics ignores how it ladders up from grassroots advocacy and local politics. 2. Our national situation didn't happen overnight...it won't be fixed in 2018. The chance of burnout is high. How can you manage your activism and expectations to make change for the long haul? How can you leverage technology and game strategy to triage\, personalize\, activate\, and track your corner of the resistance?

DESCRIPTION:Ladies\, gentlemen\, and esteemed members of the audience\, come join us for the third installment of Brian and Zoe Gray's musical funfest\, a most lamentable comedy ensured to laugh your socks off\, knock your eyes out\, and cry your head off… or something like that? We’ll sing our own songs\, sing each other’s songs\, sing other people’s songs\, sing things that shouldn’t be classified as songs in the first place\, and hopefully leave you with some sort of greater understanding of the world\, if only the realization that they really need to stop letting these two hooligans have shadow concerts.
