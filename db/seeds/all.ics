There is no one I would rather celebrate my 4-year comicaversary with than an audience full of sea monkeys\, so come see what your support and encouragement has wrought! Note: This show promises that it will not be racist\, homophobic\, misogynist\, transphobic\, nor will it pick on any marginalized cross-section of society. That said\, it may get a little dirty in places. Tastefully.
